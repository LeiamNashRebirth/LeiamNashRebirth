THE INVISIBLE AUDIENCE: SOCIAL MEDIA SURVEILLANCE AND ITS IMPACT ON TEEN PRIVACY

1. Statement of the Problem (SOP):
This study seeks to examine the impact of social media surveillance on teen privacy. With the increasing use of social media platforms, concerns arise regarding how surveillance by peers, advertisers, and other entities affects teenagers' sense of privacy and their online behavior. This research aims to highlight the implications of such surveillance on teens' privacy and develop insights into managing and protecting personal information in the digital age.
2. Variables:
Independent Variable: Social Media Surveillance (measured by the extent and types of monitoring, such as monitoring by peers, advertisers, or platform algorithms)
Dependent Variable: Teen Privacy (measured by perceptions of privacy, frequency of privacy breaches, and changes in online behavior due to perceived surveillance)
3. Framework:
The theoretical framework for this study might include:
Surveillance Theory: This theory explores how surveillance affects individuals' behavior and perceptions of privacy, focusing on the dynamics between watchers and the watched.
Privacy Theory: This theory addresses the concept of privacy and how individuals manage and perceive privacy in the context of digital interactions and surveillance.
Social Media Influence Model: This model examines how social media platforms and their surveillance mechanisms influence users' privacy practices and online behavior.
